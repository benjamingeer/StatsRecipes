{-

A one-sample t confidence interval.

Biologists studying the healing of skin wounds measured the rate at
which new cells closed a razor cut made in the skin of an anesthetized
newt. The file newts.csv contains data from 18 newts, measured in
micrometers per hour. The population distribution is Normal. Estimate
the mean rate Î¼ for all newts of this species by giving a 95%
confidence interval.
