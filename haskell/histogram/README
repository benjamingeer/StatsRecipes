Problem: The file degree.csv contains data on the percent of
population aged 25 and over with a bachelorâ€™s degree in each US
state. Make a histogram of this data. (Moore, David S. The Basic
Practice of Statistics. 4th ed. New York: W. H. Freeman, 2007,
pp. 11-12, example 1.5.)

Here we use Gnuplot to generate the histogram, which we then include
in a LaTeX document. Gnuplot can generate the plot just fine by
itself, so there's no Haskell in this example.

Cf. the "hist" function in R.
